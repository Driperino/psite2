            <h2>What even <i>is</i> a Capstone Project?</h2>
            <p>A capstone project is a multifaceted assignment that serves as a culminating academic and intellectual
                experience at the end of a student's academic program.
                It's often undertaken in the final year of study, though the specific timing and requirements can vary
                depending on the institution and the program of study.
                <br><br>
                Capstone projects are designed to integrate and apply the knowledge and skills acquired throughout the
                duration of the academic program.
                They typically involve substantial research, analysis, and synthesis of information, often requiring
                students to tackle real-world problems or address complex issues within their field of study.
                <br><br>
                The objectives of a capstone project may include:
                <br><br>
            <ol class="list-group-numbered">
                <li class="list-group-item">Demonstration of Mastery: Capstone projects provide students with the
                    opportunity to demonstrate their mastery of the subject matter and the skills they have acquired
                    during their academic journey.</li>
                <li class="list-group-item">Application of Knowledge: Students are expected to apply the theoretical
                    concepts and practical skills learned in their coursework to address a specific problem or question.
                </li>
                <li class="list-group-item">Critical Thinking and Analysis: Capstone projects often require students to
                    critically evaluate information, analyze data, and make evidence-based decisions or recommendations.
                </li>
                <li class="list-group-item">Communication and Presentation: Students typically present their capstone
                    projects through written reports, oral presentations, or other forms of communication, showcasing
                    their ability to effectively convey their findings and conclusions.</li>
                <li class="list-group-item">Collaboration and Teamwork: In some cases, capstone projects may be
                    completed individually, while in others, they may involve collaboration with peers, faculty members,
                    or external organizations.</li>
